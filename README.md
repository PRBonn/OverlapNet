# OverlapNet - Loop Closing for 3D LiDAR-based SLAM

### OverlapNet was nominated as the Best System Paper at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2020 

**This repo contains the pytorch implemention of OverlapNet.**   

OverlapNet is modified Siamese Network that predicts the overlap and relative yaw angle of a pair of range images generated by 3D LiDAR scans. 

Developed by [Xieyuanli Chen](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/xieyuanli-chen/) and [Thomas Läbe](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/thomas-laebe/).

This pytorch-implemention is developed by [Junyi Ma](https://github.com/BIT-MJY)
